#Codelite templates

The archive *project_templates.zip* contains project templates for C and C++ projects.
1. To use these templates, copy the archive to *~/.codelite/templates/projects* and unzip it there.
2. Then, two new folders *cppp_c* and *cppp_cpp* should appear.
3. To test the templates, open Codelite, add a new project, open the group *CPPP*, and select *C++ Projekt* or *C Projekt*.
